**1. Layout.html**

Wrote the initial templates for use with Django, which teammates used as a basis/standard for writing other templates. Contributed to all templates in our project, this file was the first template written and is the base layout for our site.

**2. models.py**

Wrote the initial models for use with Django, this file defines our database fields which are translated to our SQLite database by Django. I created the first iteration of the file which other members used as an example for further contributions.

**3. search_indexes.py**

Model file for our search functionality, which is based on the django-haystack plugin. This file defines the model fields that our search functionality will index, as well as providing field names for our search results template. This has allowed us to easily implement robust search functionality into our application.

**4. tests.py**

Created initial tests for our django models, and added Selenium test functionality. I connected this with our continuous integration platform (Travis) and setup a virtual display on our CI to allow Selenium testing to work remotely. These automated tests have allowed us to be confident that our application still works correctly as we add new features.

**5. User Stories**

Contributed to the development of our user stores (creating and editing), as well as negotiating priorities with our client in and outside of class. We are implementing these user stories in our sprints, and having well planned user stories has allowed us to work far more effectively.
